# SQL  Constraints

## Description
1. Constraints are rules that define the relationships and characteristics of the data in a database. 
2. Constraints are used to enforce data integrity rules on the data stored in tables.
3. They help maintain consistency and accuracy within the database by preventing the insertion of invalid or inconsistent data.

## Types Of Constraints
1. PRIMARY KEY: Ensures that each row in a table is unique and identifies it uniquely.
2. FOREIGN KEY: Establishes a link between two tables, ensuring referential integrity.
3. CHECK: Enforces a condition that values in a column must satisfy.
4. UNIQUE: Ensures that all values in a column are unique.
5. NOT NULL: Requires that a column cannot contain NULL values.

## Best Practices
1. Choose meaningful names for constraints.
2. Use constraints to reflect the business rules accurately.
3. Avoid creating constraints that are too restrictive and may hinder legitimate operations.
